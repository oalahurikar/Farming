# Data Driven Farming

## Project Overview
In this project, the vertical farming prototype is developed where the growth of plants is stimulated with artificial light and a measured dose of water nutrition.
Sensors are used to collect the real-time information to understand  different parameters  to monitor  and  stimulate plant growth.

## Implementation
Sensors used Light intensity, thermometer, 
**Raspberry Pi, Arduino controller**, Python
