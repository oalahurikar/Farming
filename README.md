# Data Driven Farming

## Project Overview
In this project, the vertical farming prototype is developed where the growth of plants is stimulated with artificial light and a measured dose of water nutrition.
Sensors are used to collect real-time information to understand  different parameters  to monitor  and  stimulate plant growth.

## Implementation
Sensors used for the project are light intensity, thermometer, soil moisture, and air humidity. 
Python coding and hardware like **Raspberry Pi, and Arduino controllers** are used to analyze and push sensor data over the cloud for post-processing.
